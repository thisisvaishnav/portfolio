# Every Day You Choose: Fear or Dreams

Every single morning when you wake up, whether you realize it or not—you’re making a choice. You’re either feeding your **fears**, or you’re feeding your **dreams**.

There’s no standing still. Life doesn’t wait. You start in the middle, neutral—then step by step, day by day, you inch toward one of two outcomes: the life you **dream of**, or the life you **fear**.

## What’s the Dream, What’s the Fear?

Your **dream** is everything you’ve ever wanted to become. The version of you who took full control of your potential, made your parents proud, built a legacy, and helped your people rise up too.

Your **fear** is the version of you that never made it. The version that had the vision but never followed through. That stayed “comfortable,” avoided the hard stuff, and in the end—never became who they were meant to be.

And the difference?
It’s what you **feed**.
Consistently.

## You Don’t Get to Sit This One Out

Here’s the harsh truth: you were born into this game, whether you like it or not. Life started the moment you took your first breath. You don’t get to “opt out.” You don’t get to say, “I’m not feeling motivated today.” You’re already **all in**—so act like it.

If you’re already here, already playing the game—then why not give it **everything** you’ve got?

## It’s Bigger Than You

Maybe you’ve given up on yourself. But even if you don’t care about you—what about your **parents**?
Your mother literally carried you in her womb for 9 months. She gave up everything, sacrificed, and poured all her love into you. Your father worked day and night to give you a shot at a better life.
You owe it to them to become the best version of yourself.

And it's not just your parents. It's your **friends**, your future **family**, your **community**. Someone has to rise. Someone has to make it. Why not you?

You know deep down that not everyone in your circle is going to make it. But that doesn’t give you permission to bail. **If they believed in you, showed you love, had your back—then it’s your job to lift them up too.**

## Fear Compounds. So Does Action.

Here’s the dangerous part: when you keep feeding your fears, it becomes a habit. It compounds.
You skip one day—then another—and suddenly, you’ve wasted weeks. Months. Years.

You can’t just “yurt” back (turn it around) overnight. You’ve drifted far, and it takes real work to come back.

But listen: **it’s not too late**.
You’re still breathing. You still have time. Just not as much as you think.

So stop wasting it.

## Final Message

Every moment you’re alive, you’re already making a choice. You’re either investing in your **dreams**, or you’re giving your energy to your **fears**.

You’re already **in the game**. So go all in.
Not just for you—but for the ones who believed in you, the ones who raised you, the ones who still need you to win.

Get up.
Show up.
And feed your dreams—every single day.
